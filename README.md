# Code for Good 2019 - Team 4 project
Our team basically developed an App and a WebApp around the required use case of pisciculture.

## Workflow
* Farmer enters activity data.
* Farmer gets more detailed instruction.
* Then farmer will get to view his/her rating like which will be automated/submitted by an expert.
* The farmer can mention about the number of fishes that were healthy.
* Then a buying option for the farmer like if he/she wants fishing nets,new breeds eggs, etc.
* Then a selling option for the farmer where he/she can sell their healthy fishes in terms of weight.
* We have an AR based learning-model for the farmers where they can be shown hands-on kind of tutorials.
* We have a monitoring dashboard where the experts can monitor the ongoing fields in the fields and the farmers.

## Future Scope
* Multilingual Support
* Filter for searching products on basis of rating, distance, price, etc.
* Real time updates
* AR support in moving model
